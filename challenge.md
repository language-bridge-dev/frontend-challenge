# Frontend Engineer Technical Test

Welcome to this technical test! The main goal is to demonstrate your **frontend development** skills, best coding practices, **responsiveness**, **accessibility**, and overall ability to build maintainable and scalable applications.

## Overview

You are required to implement a **photo gallery** that populates with images taken via the user’s camera. Specifically:

1. **Camera Usage**

   - Provide a button (e.g., “Start Camera”) that activates the user’s camera.
   - Use the [MediaDevices getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) API (or an equivalent approach) to capture images.
   - Once the camera is active, include an additional Take Photo button. This button should capture the current frame from the camera stream when clicked.

2. **Photo Gallery**

   - Display the captured photos in **thumbnails on the left side** of the page (or in a dedicated panel/section).
   - Implement **pagination** for the gallery. Only a limited number of thumbnails should be shown on each page (e.g., 6 or 9), with the ability to navigate forward and backward.
   - (Optional) When a thumbnail is clicked, you can showcase the photo in a larger view.

3. **Design & Layout**

   - The interface should be **responsive** and adapt well to different screen sizes (mobile, tablets, desktop).
   - **Accessibility** is important (use semantic HTML tags, `alt` attributes, `aria-` labels, etc.).

4. **Best Practices**
   - Use a **component-based** approach or any architectural pattern you consider appropriate (e.g., MVC, functional components, etc.).
   - Keep your code clean, readable, and well-organized.
   - Handle errors properly, including camera permission issues.
   - Provide basic documentation (in code or in the README) explaining technical decisions.

## Technical Requirements

- You must use React as a framework.
- Feel free to use any package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm).
- Your application must be runnable locally with clear instructions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**

  - Does the application successfully capture images from the camera?
  - Are the images stored and displayed in a paginated gallery?

- **Code Quality**

  - Readability, cleanliness, and organization.
  - Use of standards and best practices (naming, folder structure, etc.).

- **Design & Usability**

  - Does the interface meet the requirements?
  - Is it responsive and accessible?

- **Documentation**
  - Clear instructions on how to clone, install, and run the project locally.
  - Notes on any significant technical decisions.

## How to Submit

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Create a new branch named after you (e.g., `feature/your-name`).
3. Implement your solution on that branch.
4. **Include instructions** in the README (or a separate file) describing how to run the project:
   - How to install dependencies.
   - How to start the local development server (or open an HTML file if no server is used).
   - Any special configurations needed.
5. **Create a Pull Request** back to this repository from your fork. In the PR description, provide a brief overview of how to test your solution.

## Delivery

- Ideally, submit your PR within **1-2 days**.
- If you need more time or have any questions, please reach out.

## Optional Extras

- State management (Redux, Context API, etc.) if relevant to your chosen stack.
- Storing photos in LocalStorage or IndexedDB so they persist upon page reload.
- Basic unit or integration tests.
- Additional UI/UX details (animations, camera preview features, etc.).

### Documents

- Screenshots or additional documentation can also be placed in a `docs/` folder (e.g., `docs/screenshots/`) if needed.
